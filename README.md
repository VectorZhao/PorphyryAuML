# PorphyryAuML 🌍🔬

## Introduction
Welcome to the PorphyryAuML project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the mechanism of gold (Au) enrichment in porphyry systems within the Central Asian Orogenic Belt using machine learning. We apply models like XGBoost and Random Forest to analyze whole-rock geochemical data, aiming to classify porphyry deposit types and highlight key geochemical indicators.

## Key Features
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality to discover the most significant variables.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize XGBoost and Random Forest for robust classification.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identify crucial geochemical markers for Au presence and quantity.
- **Visualization:** Detailed plots to illustrate model outcomes and geochemical patterns.
